## About The Project

### Cinema Booking System

The Cinema Booking System is a web application designed to mimic the functionality of an actual online booking system used by cinemas. Inspired by the Shaw Theatres' website, this application offers a comprehensive and user-friendly experience for booking movie tickets

### Project Aim

The main goal of this project is to simulate the user journey of booking seats for a movie showtime. Users can experience the full process of selecting a movie, choosing a showtime, and reserving seats. Additionally, the system provides an admin interface for managing the primary entities of a cinema, including movies, showtimes, and halls
